I am currently an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) with the Department of Coputer Science at St. Francis Xavier University. Starting from July 1st, 2023, I will be joining Lakehead University as an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) with the Department of Software Engineering. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Toronto from 2021 to 2022  and a Visiting Scholar at Ontario Tech University from 2016 to 2017. I received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Ontario Tech University in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Min Dong](https://faculty.ontariotechu.ca/dong/). Prior to that, I received the Master's degree from Zhejiang Gongshang University (China) in 2016 and the Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University of Technology (China) in 2012, both in Computer Science.

My research mainly focuses on utilizing optimization techniques to solve practical problems in networks. I am currently working on the optimization of MapReduce-based coded distributed computing in heterogeneous networks, with a special interest in speeding up the computing of machining learning jobs. My researches in caching have greatly advanced the state-of-art understanding of the fundamental limit of caching under nonuniform user demands. I had research experiences in algorithmic mechanism design, network security, differential privacy and applied cryptography. I am also interested in looking into research problems about the mechanism design and security in coded caching and distributed computing networks.
