I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Ontario Tech University, under the supervision of [Dr. Min Dong](https://faculty.ontariotechu.ca/dong/). Prior to that, I received  both Master's degree from Zhejiang Gongshang University (China) and Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University of Technology (China), both in Computer Science.

My research mainly focuses on utilizing optimization techniques to solve practical problems in networks. I am currently working on the optimization of MapReduce-based coded distributed computing in heterogeneous networks, with a special interest in speeding up the computing of machining learning jobs. My Ph.D. thesis focuses on the optimization of coded caching and distributed computing for heterogeneous networks. I am also interested in looking into research problems about the mechanism design and security in coded caching and distributed computing networks. I also have research experiences in algorithmic mechanism design, network security, differential privacy and applied cryptography.
