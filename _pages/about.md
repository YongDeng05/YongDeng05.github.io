I am a Postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto. I was a Visiting scholar at Ontario Tech University from 2016 to 2017. I received my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Ontario Tech University in 2021, under the supervision of [Dr. Min Dong](https://faculty.ontariotechu.ca/dong/). Prior to that, I received  the Master's degree from Zhejiang Gongshang University (China) in 2016 and the Bachelor's degree from Wuhan University of Technology (China) in 2012, both in Computer Science.

My research mainly focuses on utilizing optimization techniques to solve practical problems in networks. I am currently working on the optimization of MapReduce-based coded distributed computing in heterogeneous networks, with a special interest in speeding up the computing of machining learning jobs. My Ph.D. thesis focuses on the optimization of coded caching and distributed computing for heterogeneous networks. I am also interested in looking into research problems about the mechanism design and security in coded caching and distributed computing networks. I also have research experiences in algorithmic mechanism design, network security, differential privacy and applied cryptography.
